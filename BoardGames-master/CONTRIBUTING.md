# Contributing
This repository is for educational purposes, so contributions are very encouraged.
You can contribute by:  
- **Pull request**: Follow the section **Getting started** in the [README](https://github.com/mattiadg/BoardGames/blob/master/README.md)
to set up the project and start coding. Don't forget to fork the code!
- **Issues**: Open an issue to report a bug, request a new feature (that you can implement with a PR), or writing the 
code better. One of the purposes of this repository is to learn C++, so don't assume that everything is as it should be.

## What can I do?
The [issues](https://github.com/mattiadg/BoardGames/issues) contain features to add to the code. The ones labeled 
"Hacktoberfest" or "good first issue" do not require much effort.  
If you want to work on an issue, please comment to let everybody know that you are in charge of it. You can also 
ask for suggestions on where to start looking for working on it.

If you want to add a new feature, please open an issue first. A pull request should always refer to an open issue.
If the issue has not been accepted, you can still open a PR but don't expect it to be accepted.

Improvements on the code are always welcome, documentation for the newcomers is even better!

If you like this repository and want to contribute, please do not forget to fork it and give us a star.
